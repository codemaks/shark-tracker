# Shark tracking application

**1st year course project**: Shark tracking application using OSEARCH data

## Domain description

*The [not-for-profit organisation] OCEARCH has been busy tagging great white sharks
and tracking their movements in near real time, using new technology to advance our
understanding of these wondrous sea creatures.*

*OCEARCH works with 20 different institutions and it even has its own at-sea laboratory.
“[Utilising] a custom 75,000 lb.-capacity hydraulic platform designed to safely lift mature
sharks for access by a multi-disciplined research team, up to 12 studies are conducted in
approximately 15 minutes on a live mature shark,” the [organisation] says of its M/V
OCEARCH vessel. The data collected from these expeditions aids in conservation efforts
for great white sharks as well as promoting a better understanding of these apex predators
and their role in the ecosystem.*

*The research – such as tagging and blood sample collection – means only minimal discomfort
for the sharks, and there’s been no evidence of long-term problems or pain, according to
OCEARCH (Source: International Business Times).*

## Functionalities

* Connect to a server to access shark tracking data
* Search for sharks that have appeared within a given
time frame (in the last 24 hours, in the last week or in the last month)
* Filter the search for sharks by gender, stage of life and tag
location
* Display all pertinent shark details, including species,
length, weight and a description of the shark, ordered by recency
* "Follow" a shark such that they appear in a list of favourites
* Different user profiles
* Show visual statistics about the types of shark present in a
given time period
* "Shark of the day" feature
* Display a map that depicts the geographical location of all
followed sharks

## Aims

* Developing user-friendly interfaces;
* Building self-contained applications with widgets, layout managers and event han-
dlers;
* Using a version control system for managing source code;
* Interpreting application requirements that go beyond a Computer Science technical
level and relate to application domain user needs;
* Identifying difficulties in GUI design;
* Working with pre-existing code, provided as a library;
* Performing task analysis and UI design;
* Documenting code.
